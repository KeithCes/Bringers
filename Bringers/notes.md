# stuff to do soon
- texting/calling support
- increment order

# shit to do if bored
- modulate button (place order, login, accept order, etc)
- supposed to use getToken() instead of uid for authing; less secure? later problem...
- editing yourprofile and then going to placeorder acts like keyboard is still up for a second
- placeholder for profile picture looks a bit janky, design a better one and replace on youprofile and map views

# stuff to add later

- when email is changed the email is only changed in db not auth (login uses creation email)
- slight flickering of keyboard when password fields selected (create)
- item name/description on confirmation screen
- seperate all logic from view into viewmodel
- views get funky on very small screen sizes (ipod touch, iphone 8, iphone se)
- databse rules: make user unable to read email, phone number from other users
- custom cropping profile picture
- add push notifications for bringer coming/order complete/etc

# stuff to do soon
- create account dob constraints are off
- get profile picture on order/bringer screens; its still scarra i think

# shit to do if bored
- modulate button (place order, login, accept order, etc)
- supposed to use getToken() instead of uid for authing; less secure? later problem...
- editing yourprofile and then going to placeorder acts like keyboard is still up for a second

# stuff to add later

- when email is changed the email is only changed in db not auth (login uses creation email)
- slight flickering of keyboard when password fields selected (create)
- item name/description on confirmation screen
- seperate all logic from view into viewmodel
- views get funky on very small screen sizes (ipod touch, iphone 8, iphone se)
- databse rules: make user unable to read email, phone number from other users

# stuff to do soon
- databse rules


# shit to do if bored
- modulate button (place order, login, accept order, etc)
- supposed to use getToken() instead of uid for authing; less secure? later problem...
- editing yourprofile and then going to placeorder acts like keyboard is still up for a second

# stuff to add later

- slight flickering of keyboard when password fields selected (create)
- item name/description on confirmation screen
- seperate all logic from view into viewmodel
- views get funky on very small screen sizes (ipod touch, iphone 8, iphone se)
